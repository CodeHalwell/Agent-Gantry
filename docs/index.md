# Agent-Gantry documentation home

Start here for an overview of the available guides and how to navigate the docs.

- **Quick start**: See `README.md` at the repository root for installation and basic usage.
- **Vector store + LLM wiring**: `vector_store_llm_integration.md` shows how to register many tools,
  build a vector index, and present tools to OpenAI, Google GenAI, and Claude SDKs.
- **Roadmap phases**: `phase2.md`, `phase5_mcp.md`, and `phase6_a2a.md` track planned milestones.
- **SDK compatibility**: `llm_sdk_compatibility.md` summarizes what each provider expects.

All docs are Markdown files to make it easy to copy code into your projects. Contributions are
