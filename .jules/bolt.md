## 2023-10-27 - Vectorized MMR implementation
**Learning:** The MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) implementation in `SemanticRouter._apply_mmr` uses a nested loop in pure Python to calculate cosine similarity between the current candidate and all previously selected items (`O(K * |candidates| * |selected|)` dot products).
**Action:** Replace the nested loop with a vectorized approach using numpy. By normalizing the embeddings upfront and calculating similarities via matrix multiplication `np.dot(normed_emb, last_selected_emb)`, we can drastically reduce CPU time. Maintain a running array of `max_sims` to avoid re-evaluating similarities with all previously selected tools at each step.

## 2026-04-16 - Optimize string serialization of embedding vectors
**Learning:** Using Python's built-in `json.dumps()` is significantly faster and safer for serializing large numerical lists (like embeddings) compared to generator expressions with string concatenation (`"[" + ",".join(str(x) for x in embedding) + "]"`), and it is much safer than `str()` because it reliably produces a Postgres array-compatible format (`[1.0, 2.0]`) regardless of whether the input is a list, tuple, or numpy array.
**Action:** Use `json.dumps()` whenever bulk-converting lists to string representations.

## 2023-10-27 - Fast JSON float array serialization
**Learning:** For converting large lists of floats (like vector embeddings) into strings for database queries, `json.dumps(embedding)` is measurably faster (about ~7-8% speedup) and more readable than using a generator expression with string concatenation `("[" + ",".join(str(x) for x in embedding) + "]")`.
**Action:** Use standard `json.dumps` instead of manual string parsing when passing vector data as strings to database drivers like `asyncpg`.

## 2023-10-27 - Fast token matching with substring pre-check
**Learning:** In string parsing functions that use compiled regular expressions (like `_get_token_pattern(token).search(text)`), evaluating the regex engine is expensive. When the token does not exist in the text at all, the regex engine still scans the whole string.
**Action:** Always add a fast substring pre-check (`if token not in text: return False`) before running the regular expression. The native Python `in` operator uses highly optimized C algorithms and provides a massive speedup (>10x in microbenchmarks) for the non-matching case.

## 2023-10-27 - Fast capability filtering with set operations
**Learning:** In Python, using generator expressions combined with `all` or `any` (e.g., `all(cap in capabilities for cap in required)`) inside tight loops like vector search evaluation introduces significant execution overhead. This is because it relies on the Python interpreter to evaluate each item lazily.
**Action:** When filtering or comparing collections in performance-sensitive paths, convert them to sets and use native set operations like `issubset()` and `isdisjoint()`. These are evaluated in highly optimized C code, providing a measurable performance improvement (often ~3x faster) compared to pure Python iterators.
